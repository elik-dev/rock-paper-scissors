# rock-paper-scissors
In this project I'm going to test skills obtained from JavaScript Basics section of The Odin Project<br>
This will be a basic rock paper scissors game<br>
The player input will be through prompt window and the output through alert<br>
Type `playRound();` to the console to play one round of Rock Paper Scissors
